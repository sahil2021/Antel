# Training set => Learning Algorithm => H(x)

# [x] => H(x) => [Y]

## Training Set :  Is a historic data that is gathered over time.

### For Example :  House Size | House Price(K)
###              2140__|__400
###               416___|__232
###               1534__|__315
###              852___|__178

## Learning Algorithm : Is a approch to create hypothesis H(x) function to predict value of expected variable based on mathematical models and analytical results.
