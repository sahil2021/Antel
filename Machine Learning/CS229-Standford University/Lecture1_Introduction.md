# Machine Learning

## Arthur Samuel(1959) describes machine learning as a field of study that gives computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
## Tom Mitchell(1997) gives more modern defination, "Computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and some performance measure P, If its performance in task T as measure by P, improves with experience E."

#### Example: Playing Checker
#### E Experience of playing many games of checkers.
#### T Task of playing checker.
#### P The probability of the algorithm will win the next game.

## In general, Any machine learning problem can be assign to one of the two broad categories:
# Supervised Learning
# Unsupervised Learning
