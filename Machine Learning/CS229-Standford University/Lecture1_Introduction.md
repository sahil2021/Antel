# Machine Learning

* ## Arthur Samuel(1959) describes machine learning as a field of study that gives computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* ## Tom Mitchell(1997) gives more modern definition, "Computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and some performance measure P, If its performance in task T as measure by P, improves with experience E."

* #### Example: Playing Checker
    #### E Experience of playing many games of checkers.
    #### T Task of playing checker.
    #### P The probability of the algorithm will win the next game.

## In general, Any machine learning problem can be assign to one of the two broad classifications:
* ## Supervised Learning
* ## Unsupervised Learning
